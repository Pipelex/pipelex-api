"""Local ↔ hosted parity of the MTHDS Protocol surfaces (the Phase 3a E2E diff).

The alignment's end-to-end claim: a client of the Pipelex family can write portable code
across the local runtime and the hosted API. Each scenario here calls the local
`PipelexMTHDSProtocol` directly AND the HTTP route with the same payload, then asserts the
shared report keys are byte-identical and the wire extras (`mthds_contents`, `message`)
appear on the HTTP envelope only. `is_valid` is a canonical report field on both backends (not a
wire extra — the `success` extra is retired). `graph_spec` is compared by presence/absence,
not value: it carries run-specific identity (graph id, node timings, random dry-run data),
so two runs never serialize identically.

One report field is gated on the wire rather than dropped: `input_form` is an opt-in structured
view the route attaches only when the request's `views` names it. So the parity call opts in — the
claim is that the projection is byte-identical to the local report's, not that a default call
carries it — and a second assertion pins the gate itself: a default call omits exactly the opt-in
views and nothing else.

The validate fixtures mirror the protocol-alignment baseline scenarios: the lenient
signature batch, the strict header+definition batch, the no-`main_pipe` batch (the D2
regression surface), and a complete main-pipe bundle (the only one producing a graph).
