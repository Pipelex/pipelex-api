"""Route-level tests for the run-source precondition on /execute and /start.

Pins the layered extension policy's Rule 4 (`docs/specs/pipelex-platform-api.md`
→ "Layered extension policy"): an unknown extension key never waives the
requirement that a run request carry a source this server understands, and a
source-less body whose keys this deployment does not handle gets a message that
NAMES them — so "a hosted client was pointed at an open-source runner" reads as
that, instead of as a generic precondition failure.

The runner is mocked as in `test_pipeline_routes`; nothing here reaches inference,
because every assertion lands on a request-shape 422 raised during body parsing.
