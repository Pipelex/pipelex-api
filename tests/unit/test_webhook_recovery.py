"""Cross-path consistency regression for the API's two error surfaces.

The API surfaces a pipelex `ErrorReport` to clients along two paths:

1. The **synchronous HTTP path** — `POST /execute` (and every other
   route that propagates a `PipelexError`) renders the report via
   `build_problem_document(...)` → RFC 7807 `application/problem+json`.
2. The **asynchronous webhook path** — `POST /start` schedules a
   Temporal workflow; on completion (success or `FAILED`), pipelex's
   `DeliveryExecutor._notify_webhook(...)` posts a JSON payload to the
   caller's callback URL. On `FAILED`, the payload carries
   `error: <ErrorReport.to_dict(disclosure_mode=VERBOSE)>` — a flat dict, not
   an RFC 7807 envelope (the receiver chooses how to render it).

This module pins the **T6 cross-path consistency** invariant: given the same
source `ErrorReport`, both renderings must surface the same classification
fields. A client that branches on `error_type` / `error_domain` /
`retryable` / `user_action` must not get one classification synchronously
and a different one over the webhook.

The webhook payload itself is composed entirely upstream in
`pipelex.pipe_run.delivery_executor`; the API never touches the bytes that
go over the wire. So this test exercises the two rendering helpers directly
and asserts the classification overlap is exact. Drift here would imply
either pipelex's `to_dict` / `to_problem_document` diverged in their field
selection, or the API's `build_problem_document` wrapper started shaping
the document.
