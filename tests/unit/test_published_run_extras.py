"""The published run request schemas carry every extension field the routes read.

`/execute` and `/start` read their extensions through `PipelineApiExtras`, while the OpenAPI
artifact publishes them from two separate documentation models. A field added to the first and
not the second is honored on the wire yet absent from the contract, so no generated client can
send it, and nothing else fails.
