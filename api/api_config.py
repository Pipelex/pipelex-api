"""Pipelex-API deployment config: the top-level orchestration mode + override policy.

The runner is orchestrator-agnostic. WHICH orchestrator a top-level run dispatches
to — ``direct`` in-process (the base default), ``temporal``, ``mistralai-workflows``,
… — is a *deployment* choice, never a property of this open-source base.
``orchestration_mode`` is an open string token (core owns ``"direct"``; each plugin
owns its own); the *delivery* axis (blocking vs fire-and-forget) is endpoint-set, not
configured here. It is read from a packaged ``api.toml`` (keys at the file root — no
``[api]`` wrapper, since :meth:`load_plugin_config` validates the whole document
against the schema, exactly like ``temporal.toml``), env-layered like the main pipelex
config and every plugin config (D2): the packaged default ``api.toml`` (shipped in this
wheel) is deep-merged with the env-selected ``api_{environment}.toml`` and
``api_override.toml`` from ``~/.pipelex`` then the project ``.pipelex``, with
``PIPELEX_ENV`` (``runtime_manager.environment``) choosing the env file. One image
bakes every env file; a deployment flavor (e.g. ``pipelex-api-hosted``) bakes
``.pipelex/api_{env}.toml`` to flip the default. The base names no orchestrator and
ships ``orchestration_mode = "direct"``.

Why a separate ``api.toml`` and not the core ``pipelex_{env}.toml``: core's
config is ``extra="forbid"``, so an ``[api]`` section there is rejected at load.
Loading it via core's reusable :meth:`load_plugin_config` keeps this a pure
pipelex-api concern while reusing the identical env-layering machinery — and
keeps it symmetric with how ``pipelex-temporal`` self-loads ``temporal.toml``.
