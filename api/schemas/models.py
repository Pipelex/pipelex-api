    The MTHDS Protocol has no request model (`mthds` deleted `RunRequest`: the
    request body is just the basic args the runner already takes as named
    parameters). pipelex-api keeps a typed model so it can publish the request
    schema in its OpenAPI artifact and parse the body once.

    The declared fields are the protocol's **basic** arguments. The model is
    deliberately open (`extra="allow"`): a caller may send extra request
    properties, and they are kept rather than silently dropped. Openness is not
    a waiver, though — an unknown key never satisfies the run-source
    precondition. Under the layered extension policy (the Pipelex workspace
    spec `docs/specs/pipelex-platform-api.md` → "Layered extension policy"), an
    extension-borne method selector is resolved by the layer that owns it
    BEFORE the request reaches this one, so a body arriving here with no source
    this server understands is an error whatever else it carries.

    Attributes:
        pipe_code: Code of the pipe to execute.
        mthds_contents: List of MTHDS bundle contents to load.
        inputs: Inputs in PipelineInputs format — Pydantic validation is skipped
            to preserve the flexible format (dicts, strings, StuffContent objects, etc.).
        output_name: Name of the output slot to write to.
        output_multiplicity: Output multiplicity setting.
        dynamic_output_concept_ref: Override for the dynamic output concept ref.
        bundle_b64: PIPELEX-API EXTENSION — base64-encoded zip of the whole method
            bundle (`.mthds` + `.py` + `structures/*.py` + `requirements.txt`). Lets a
            caller ship custom PipeFunc Python alongside the method; materialized into a
            temporary library directory before the run. Mutually exclusive with `files`.

            unzipped equivalent of `bundle_b64`). Mutually exclusive with `bundle_b64`.
        method_ref: PIPELEX-API EXTENSION — run a published method by address instead of
            inline source. Resolved by THIS runner (git fetch at the tag, package located
            by manifest identity); mutually exclusive with `mthds_contents` and with a
