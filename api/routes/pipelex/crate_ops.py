"""Shared crate-resolution plumbing for the `/resolve`, `/codegen` and `/build/*` routes.

They all select a closure the same way (inline `files[]` XOR `method_ref`), resolve it through the
same engine core (`pipelex.pipeline.resolve_bundle.resolve_crate_from_contents`), and speak the same
verdict vocabulary as `POST /validate`: a produced verdict is a 200 discriminated on `is_valid`, with
the invalid arm carrying the structured `validation_errors[]` built by pipelex's one shared builder.
This module holds the pieces they share so the envelopes cannot drift.

The invalid arm here is the *crate* verdict: it deliberately omits `/validate`'s runnability facts
(`pending_signatures`, `is_runnable`) — resolution is static (no dry-run sweep, matching
`pipelex resolve`), so runnability is not part of its vocabulary. The per-pipe projections
(`/build/{inputs,output}`) ride that same static core: a template is a read of the pipe's *declared*
IO, so a valid verdict there says the closure is structurally sound, never that the pipe runs.
`/build/runner` is the exception — it needs the dry-run sweep, so it keeps `validate_bundle`.
