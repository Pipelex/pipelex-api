    The one `/build/*` projection that is **not** static: a runner script is a promise the pipe can
    actually run, so this route keeps the dry-run sweep its siblings dropped (and with it
    `allow_signatures`, which only ever parameterized that sweep). `validate_bundle` opens a single
    library, loads the closure, sweeps, and on success leaves the library loaded + current; on failure
    it tears it down itself. On the success path the crate is read from that library, the
    `python-structures` projection is emitted and stamped, and the runner script is generated with the
    **emitted** class names — the same flow as a local `pipelex build runner`.

    The sweep is scoped to the requested pipe, so unrelated broken siblings do not block a good pipe.
    When `pipe_ref` is omitted the scope cannot be known before the closure loads, so the whole closure
    is swept and the pipe then defaults to its `main_pipe` — a stricter verdict, and the honest one for
    a caller who did not say which pipe they meant.

    Response contract (the `/validate` discipline): an invalid closure — including a failed dry-run of
    the requested pipe — is a produced verdict: a **200** `is_valid: false` with the structured
    `validation_errors[]`. Non-2xx is reserved for no-verdict conditions: a request-shape 422 (an
    unknown pipe ref, an omitted `pipe_ref` on a closure with no — or several — `main_pipe`, or a
    requested pipe whose cross-package dependencies are absent from the request), a 501 for
