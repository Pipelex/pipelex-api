      `validated_pipes` sweep outcomes, `pending_signatures` + `is_runnable` runnability verdict,

      `default_pipe_ref`). A bundle that declares no `main_pipe` validates fine and carries
      `graph_spec=null`. Pending signatures are reported as `pending_signatures` +
      `is_runnable: false`, never as an error. `default_pipe_ref` names the pipe a selector-less
      run of this same request would execute — on a `method_ref` request that is the fetched
      manifest's `main_pipe`, which the canonical report cannot see, so the field is the only
      signal a consumer can project a by-address entry signature from.
      The opt-in `views` token `input_form` additionally attaches the per-pipe input-form
      descriptors as a same-named top-level field, keyed like `pipe_io_contracts`; without the
      token the field is absent and the body is byte-identical to a request that omits `views`.
    - **Invalid verdict (200, `is_valid: false`):** the `InvalidReport` arm — `validation_errors[]`
      (the structured per-error diagnostics, built by pipelex's one shared builder, incl. the
      `dry_run` residual item) + `message`, with the structural artifacts absent. The runner
      returns this as a value (`ErrorReport` with `validation_errors`) regardless of backend — the
      in-process arm from the bundle's `ValidateBundleError`, the dispatched arm recovered from the
      worker — so the route maps it to a 200 by matching validation diagnostics, never by catching an
      exception. Returned `ErrorReport`s without validation diagnostics are backend/config/runtime
      faults and keep the global RFC 7807 problem response path.
    - **No verdict (non-2xx):** a malformed request body, an `mthds_sources` length mismatch, or
      both/neither of `mthds_contents` / `method_ref` is a request-shape **422**; a forbidden
      `orchestration_mode` override is a **403**; a host-wiring programmer error or a genuine
      orchestrator fault is a **5xx**; auth is **401/403**. A `method_ref` **resolution failure**
      is also a no-verdict condition — never an `is_valid: false`: a malformed reference or a
      failed fetch is a **422**, no matching package in the repository a **404**, and the
      custom-Python policy (the sandbox gate, the structures refusal) a **403**, each with the
