    Resolution is a first-class language operation alongside validation: assemble the closure from

    library crate** (fully qualified refs, refinement flattened, natives materialized, fingerprint
    set). It runs no dry-run sweep — runnability is `/validate`'s vocabulary.

    Response contract (the `/validate` discipline):

    - **Valid verdict (200, `is_valid: true`):** the crate on the valid arm.
    - **Invalid verdict (200, `is_valid: false`):** the library could not be parsed, loaded, or
      validated — `validation_errors[]` from pipelex's one shared builder.
    - **No verdict (non-2xx):** a malformed request body (neither/both closure selectors, an
      over-limit file) is a request-shape 422; `method_ref` is a 501 until server-side method
      registry resolution exists; auth is 401/403; server fault is 5xx. All RFC 7807
