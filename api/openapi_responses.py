"""Documentation-only models and shared `responses=` declarations for the API's RFC 7807 errors.

Every failure this server emits is an `application/problem+json` document built
by the global handlers in `api.exception_handlers` — from a pipelex
`ErrorReport` (`build_problem_document`) or from an API-authored `ApiError`
(`build_problem_document_from_api_error`). Neither path validates through a
Pydantic model: they build plain dicts. The models here exist **only** so the
committed OpenAPI artifact can publish that shape with a real schema instead of
an untyped `additionalProperties: true` blob — nothing in the request path
imports them, and adding a field here does not change a single response byte.
Keep them in step with `docs/error-responses.md`, which is the prose contract.

`ProblemDocument.validation_errors` reuses pipelex's own `ValidationErrorItem`,
so the item shape published on the error wire is the same one `/validate`'s 200
invalid arm publishes — including `suggested_fix`, which rides along for free.

The response dicts below are attached two ways:

- `COMMON_PROBLEM_RESPONSES` goes on the composite router in `api.routes`, so
  every auth-wrapped `/v1` operation documents the four failures any of them can
  produce. Declaring a `422` there also suppresses FastAPI's automatic
  `HTTPValidationError` response, which advertised the wrong media type and the
  wrong schema on nearly every route.
- The single-status constants go on the routes that can additionally produce
  them (`responses=` on the decorator merges over the router-level set).

The media type is NOT set here. FastAPI renders a `responses` entry's `model`
under the route's own response-class media type (`application/json`), with no
per-response override; `PipelexFastAPI.openapi()` in `api.openapi_schema`
re-keys every 4xx/5xx response onto `application/problem+json` (via
`use_problem_json_media_type`) after the schema is generated.
