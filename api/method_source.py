"""Resolve a `method_ref` into run/validate/tooling inputs: fetch → locate → refuse → materialize.

The wire field `method_ref` carries a globally resolvable address —
`github.com/<owner>/<repo>[/<selector>][@<tag>]` — and THIS runner is its resolver (the
layered extension policy's Rule 3: an address needs no catalog, so it is a layer-2 concept;
the hosted-only `method_id` never reaches this server). The grammar, the fetch-at-tag, the
manifest-identity package location, the bounds, and the structures check all live in
`pipelex.methods`; this module composes them behind the SHA-keyed clone cache
(`api.method_cache`) and shapes the result for each route family:

- The run routes and `/validate` use :func:`fetched_method_source`: the package's `.mthds`
  files travel as `mthds_contents` (paired with their real relative paths as
  `mthds_sources`, so diagnostics carry true per-file labels), and only the non-`.mthds`
  files are materialized into a temporary `library_dirs` entry — exactly the split the
  method-bundle transport uses, so a fetched package runs the same proven path.
- The tooling routes (`/resolve`, `/codegen`, `/build/*`) use
  :func:`fetch_method_mthds_files`: only the `.mthds` files, as `files[]` items. No Python
  ever loads there, so the execution-locus gate does not apply.

The security gate (packaging invariant 7 — execution locus decides): `.mthds` content is
data, always acceptable. On a deployment that is NOT sandbox-hosted, a fetched package
carrying ANY `.py` is refused with the same 403 the bundle transport uses
(`CustomCodeRequiresSandbox`) — running it would import customer code in-process. On a
sandbox-hosted deployment, PipeFunc `.py` is acceptable (captured as text, executed in the
network-blocked sandbox) but a package declaring `StructuredContent` subclasses is refused
loudly (`MethodStructuresRefusedError` → 403): structures are imported into the runner's own
process, and the rule-naming error teaches authors to express types as MTHDS concepts.

Everything a run needs is copied OUT of the cached clone before this module yields — the
`.mthds` text into memory, the rest into a per-request temp directory — so cache eviction
can never race a running pipeline.
