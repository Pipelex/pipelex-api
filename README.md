# Introduction

The **Pipelex API Server** is a FastAPI-based REST API that allows you to execute [Pipelex](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex) pipelines via HTTP requests. Deploy your pipelines as HTTP endpoints and integrate them into any application or workflow.

It is the open-source reference implementation of the **[MTHDS Protocol](https://mthds.ai)** — the minimal HTTP contract every MTHDS runner implements (`POST /execute`, `POST /start`, `POST /validate`, `GET /models`, `GET /version`). The contracts nest: **MTHDS Protocol ⊂ Pipelex API (this server) ⊂ Pipelex hosted API**. This server adds the build tooling extensions (`/build/*`) on top of the protocol; the hosted API at `api.pipelex.com/v1` adds durable runs, the method catalog, and account management on top of this server — same shapes throughout. All routes live under the `/v1` base path; the committed contract is [`docs/openapi/pipelex-api.openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi/pipelex-api.openapi.yaml).

# 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

**Official Docker image available at:** [`pipelex/pipelex-api`](https://hub.docker.com/r/pipelex/pipelex-api)

The published image is **generic and configuration-light**: Temporal is off, no S3, no remote tracing. It boots with a single required env var (`PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY`), and you bring your own [Pipelex configuration](docs/configuration.md) on top to enable storage, tracing, Temporal, or anything else.

### 1. Run with Docker

The only required env var is `PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. Get a free key (with free credits) at https://app.pipelex.com, then run:

```bash
docker run --name pipelex-api -p 8081:8081 \
  -e PIPELEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your-pipelex-gateway-api-key \
  pipelex/pipelex-api:latest
```

To require authentication on the API, add `-e AUTH_MODE=api_key -e API_KEY=your-secret` (or `AUTH_MODE=jwt` + `JWT_SECRET_KEY`). See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list of supported variables and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for `--env-file` and `docker compose` patterns if you'd rather keep config out of your shell history.

If you'd rather build the image yourself instead of pulling, replace `pipelex/pipelex-api:latest` with a local tag after `docker build -t pipelex-api .`.

### 2. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

The API is now running at `http://localhost:8081`. To customize behavior (enable Temporal, swap to S3 storage, layer in env-specific overrides, …), see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

# 🧪 Run your first pipeline

Once `/health` is green, send an inline pipeline definition and inputs to `/v1/execute`. The example below summarizes a string with a one-pipe MTHDS bundle — no files, no auth, copy-paste:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8081/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pipe_code": "summarize",
    "mthds_contents": ["domain = \"hello\"\nmain_pipe = \"summarize\"\n\n[pipe.summarize]\ntype = \"PipeLLM\"\ndescription = \"Summarize the input text in one sentence\"\ninputs = { text = \"Text\" }\noutput = \"Text\"\nprompt = \"Summarize in one sentence:\\n@text\"\n"],
    "inputs": { "text": "Pipelex turns plain-language pipeline definitions into reproducible AI workflows that run as HTTP endpoints." }
  }'
```

You'll get back a JSON response with `state: "COMPLETED"` and the summary under `pipe_output.working_memory.root.<main_stuff_name>.content`.

**Passing files (PDFs, images) as inputs.** Use the `Document` concept and point it at any HTTP(S) URL:

```json
{
  "pipe_code": "your_pipe",
  "mthds_contents": ["...your MTHDS..."],
  "inputs": {
    "cv": { "concept": "Document", "content": { "url": "https://example.com/resume.pdf" } }
  }
}
```

`Document` accepts public HTTP/HTTPS URLs, `pipelex-storage://` URIs, or base64 data URLs. For images, use the `Image` concept with the same `{ "url": "..." }` shape.

For inline MTHDS in the request, `mthds_contents` is a JSON array of raw `.mthds` (TOML) file contents as strings — typically `[open("my_pipe.mthds").read()]` from a client. See [docs/pipe-run.md](docs/pipe-run.md) for every supported input shape and the full `/execute` reference.

# 📈 How to scale Pipelex

A single Pipelex API container is great for development, prototyping, and low-concurrency workloads — pipelines run in-process and `/v1/execute` blocks the request thread until they finish.

For production-scale workloads (high concurrency, long-running pipelines, retries, durable execution, horizontal scaling), the recommended path is to run Pipelex on top of [**Temporal**](https://temporal.io/). With Temporal enabled:

- Pipeline runs become durable workflows — survive worker crashes, support retries and timeouts out of the box.
- The API container becomes a thin orchestrator: it submits workflows to a Temporal cluster and returns a `pipeline_run_id` immediately (this is what `POST /v1/start` already does).
- Pipeline execution itself runs on a separate pool of **Pipelex workers** that you scale independently from the HTTP layer.
- Async completion callbacks (`callback_urls` + `X-Completion-Signature`, see [pipe-run.md](docs/pipe-run.md)) let your application be notified when each run finishes, without polling.

Pipelex already integrates with Temporal under the hood, and the Docker image accepts `TEMPORAL_API_KEY` plus a `[temporal] is_enabled = true` override in `.pipelex/`. **A complete deployment recipe (Temporal cluster sizing, worker container, autoscaling guidance, and an end-to-end docker-compose) is coming soon.** In the meantime, if you need to scale today, get in touch on [Discord](https://go.pipelex.com/discord) and we'll help you wire it up.
