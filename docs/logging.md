# Logging

The server writes structured logs: one JSON object per line, on **stderr**, with every value the line carries sitting as a key of its own. That is the shape a log agent in front of a container ingests without a parser — the CloudWatch agent, the Google Cloud Logging agent, an OTLP collector — so a query filters on a field rather than matching a substring of a message.

## What a line looks like

An error response produces exactly one line. A caller mistake:

```json
{"time": "2026-09-18T13:53:17.919Z", "severity": "WARNING", "logger": "api.exception_handlers", "message": "API error 422: InvalidModelCategory", "request_id": "01M2TCP02W04RZG6DTM8AR508C", "event": "api_error", "route": "/v1/models", "error_type": "InvalidModelCategory", "error_domain": "input", "retryable": false, "status": 422, "detail": "Invalid model category. Valid values: extract, img_gen, llm, search"}
```

A server fault looks the same at `ERROR`, and carries the traceback under an `exception` key.

The `message` is a short, stable sentence built from the HTTP status and the error type — both of them values the server chose. Nothing a caller supplied ever reaches it: the caller-facing explanation rides the `detail` field instead, so a body crafted with newlines or quotes cannot break the line or forge a key. The sink escapes what it writes.

## The fields a line carries

These keys come from the sink itself and are on every line written by the process, this server's and the Pipelex runtime's alike:

| Key | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `time` | When the record was created — ISO 8601, UTC, milliseconds, `Z` |
| `severity` | The level name: `WARNING`, `ERROR`, … |
| `logger` | The module that emitted it |
| `message` | The human-readable summary |
| `exception` | The traceback, when the record carries one |

`request_id` comes from the request-scoped context the request-id middleware binds, so **every** record emitted while a request is in flight carries it. The example above is one of the server's own lines, but a line the Pipelex runtime emits from inside a pipeline run carries the same id, which is what ties the two together without any call site passing it along. The value is the one echoed in the response's `X-Request-ID` header and in the problem document's `request_id` member, so a caller reporting a failure hands you the key to its log lines.

The remaining keys are what the error handlers attach to an `event: "api_error"` record:

| Key | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `event` | Always `api_error` on an error line — the one key a query filters this server's error stream on |
| `route` | The request's URL path |
| `status` | The HTTP status actually sent, including any API-level override |
| `error_type` | The class or `ErrorType` name the response reports |
| `error_domain` | `input`, `config`, `runtime`, … — who fixes it |
| `error_category` | A Pipelex classification, on the failures it classifies; `unknown` on the catch-all 500 |
| `retryable` | Whether a blind retry can help, when the failure says |
| `detail` | The operator-facing explanation, the same text the response body carries — on an API-authored failure only, see below |
| `user_id` | The authenticated caller, when auth bound one |
| `pipe_code` | The pipe the request named, on a run route whose body parsed |
| `pipeline_run_id` | The run the request named, on a run route whose body parsed |
| `provider`, `model`, `provider_status_code`, `provider_request_id` | The inference provider's own identifiers, on a failure that reached one |

A key whose value is not set for this request is **absent** from the line rather than written as `null`, so a query filtering on presence gets an honest answer.

`detail` is the one field whose absence follows the failure's origin rather than the request's shape, and it is worth knowing which way round. A failure this API authored itself — a validation error, an unknown model category — carries `detail` on the record. A failure that arrives as a Pipelex `ErrorReport`, which is most `5xx` and every domain error, does not: the response body still carries a `detail`, but the record does not, because the body's text has been through disclosure redaction and the cause has not. So a `4xx` from that path logs as `API error 422: SomeError` with no explanation and no traceback, and the response is where the explanation is. Build an operator query on `error_type` and `route`, which every line carries, rather than on `detail`.

Every field in that table is a **record attribute**, which is a different thing from the message. A structured sink — `json` here, and the OTLP sink — writes them beside the message as keys. The Rich console sink renders the message alone and ignores them entirely, so a deployment that switches the sink to `"console"` does not get a more readable version of these lines: it gets `API error 500: PipelexConfigError` and nothing else. That is a reason to keep `sink = "json"` wherever the lines are being read by anything other than a person at a terminal.

Disposition follows the HTTP status, not the error domain: a `4xx` is a caller mistake and logs at `WARNING` without a traceback; a `5xx` is a server fault and logs at `ERROR` with one. See [Error Responses](error-responses.md) for the response side of the same failure.

## Configuration

The keys live in `[runtime.log]` of the `.pipelex/pipelex.toml` this repository ships, which the image copies to `/root/.pipelex/`:

```toml
[runtime.log]
default_log_level = "INFO"
sink = "json"
console_log_target = "stderr"
pretty_print_mode = "silent"

[runtime.log.package_log_levels]
pipelex = "INFO"
```

- `sink = "json"` selects the one-object-per-line renderer. The alternative, `"console"`, is the Rich renderer meant for a terminal. This server does not ask for Pipelex's `cli` extra, but that does not put the renderer out of reach: `typer` and `instructor` are core Pipelex dependencies that require Rich unconditionally, so Rich is installed in the image and an `import pipelex` loads it. Selecting `"console"` here would therefore give you a working console sink, not a refusal. This key is what keeps the renderer unused, and it is the only thing that does.
- `console_log_target = "stderr"` keeps logs off the data channel.
- `pretty_print_mode = "silent"` suppresses the "Output of pipe" panel an operator pipe would otherwise draw: there is no terminal to draw into, and a server should not spend time rendering on the thread serving a request.
- `[runtime.log.package_log_levels]` raises or lowers one package's level independently of `default_log_level`.

To change any of this for a deployment, mount a `pipelex_override.toml` into `/root/.pipelex/` with just the keys you want different — see [Configuration](configuration.md#providing-your-own-configuration-to-docker). Note that replacing the whole config directory, which that page documents as Option 2, drops the shipped `pipelex.toml` along with the three keys above and silently returns the server to Pipelex's terminal-facing defaults; a layered override does not.

## Uvicorn's own lines

Uvicorn logs through its own handlers, not through the sink above, so its startup banner and its access log are plain text rather than JSON: the banner on stderr, the access log on stdout. Pass `--no-access-log` to turn the access log off, which is what the hosted deployment does; configure uvicorn's `--log-config` if you want its lines structured too.
