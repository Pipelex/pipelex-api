# Pipe Builder

Generate input templates, output representations, and Python runner code for a pipe of an MTHDS library closure.

All three build endpoints speak the same verdict discipline as [`POST /v1/validate`](pipe-validate.md): a **produced verdict is always a `200`** discriminated on the body's `is_valid` field. The valid arm carries the built artifact; the invalid arm carries the structured `validation_errors[]` built by pipelex's one shared error builder. Non-2xx is reserved for *no verdict could be produced* — request-shape `422`, auth `401`/`403`, server `5xx` — rendered as RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` (see [Error Responses](error-responses.md)).

## The shared request envelope

All three take the same **closure selector** as [`POST /v1/resolve` and `POST /v1/codegen`](codegen.md) — inline `files[]` **XOR** a `method_ref` — plus a **pipe selector**:

- `files` (list, required unless `method_ref`): the inline MTHDS bundles forming the closure. Each item is `{ "content": "<mthds text>", "source": "<optional logical path>" }`. The optional `source` is threaded onto the blueprint, so diagnostics point at the owning file.
- `method_ref` (string): a reference to an installed/published method. Accepted by the envelope, but this server answers `501` until server-side method-registry resolution exists.
- `pipe_ref` (string, **optional**): the qualified pipe ref `domain.pipe_code` to project — the same selector as `pipelex codegen inputs --pipe`. Omitted, it defaults to the closure's declared `main_pipe`. A closure that declares **no** `main_pipe`, or **several** across domains, cannot be defaulted: an omitted `pipe_ref` is a `422` there.

Every valid arm echoes both `pipe_ref` (the ref actually projected) and `requested_pipe_ref` (the ref as submitted — **absent** when it was omitted and defaulted), so a caller can always see which pipe it got. The echoed `pipe_ref` is **always qualified**, read back off the resolved pipe: a bare code still resolves (the engine's lookup falls back across domains), but you are told `smoke.echo`, not the `echo` you sent.

## Static projections vs. the runner

`/build/inputs` and `/build/output` are **static**: they resolve the closure to its normalized crate and read the requested pipe's **declared** IO. There is no dry-run sweep, and therefore no `allow_signatures` flag (it only ever parameterized that sweep). A valid verdict from them says the closure is structurally sound and the projection matches what the pipe *declares* — it is **not** a promise the pipe runs. Runnability is [`/validate`](pipe-validate.md)'s vocabulary; ask it.

`/build/runner` is the exception. A runner script *is* a promise the pipe can run, so it keeps the dry-run sweep and keeps `allow_signatures`.

## Build Inputs

Generate an example inputs template for a pipe — the same projection `pipelex codegen inputs` writes, on both of its axes.

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/build/inputs`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "files": [
    { "content": "domain = \"cv_matching\"\nmain_pipe = \"analyze_cv_job_match\"\n\n[pipe.analyze_cv_job_match]\ntype = \"PipeLLM\"\ndescription = \"Analyze CV against job offer\"\ninputs = { cv_text = \"native.Text\", job_offer = \"native.Text\" }\noutput = \"MatchAnalysis\"", "source": "cv_matching.mthds" }
  ],
  "pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match"
}
```

**Request Fields:** the shared envelope above, plus:

- `format` (string, optional): `"json"` (default) or `"toml"`.
- `explicit` (boolean, optional, default `false`): when `true`, emit the ceremonial `{concept, content}` envelope for every input. The default is the *light*, signature-driven shape — a bare string for a Text-refining input, a bare number for a Number-refining one, and so on — which is what smart inputs accepts.

**The template rides the field its `format` names.** JSON is a parsed object in `inputs`; TOML is raw text in `inputs_toml`. TOML cannot ride as a parsed object without losing the concept comments and key order that are the reason to ask for it, and the JSON case must stay a real object because that is what clients feed straight into a run. The field the format did not select is **omitted from the body entirely**.

**Response (valid verdict, default light JSON):**

```json
{
  "is_valid": true,
  "pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match",
  "requested_pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match",
  "format": "json",
  "explicit": false,
  "inputs": {
    "cv_text": "text_value",
    "job_offer": "text_value"
  },
  "message": "Inputs template generated successfully"
}
```

With `"explicit": true`, each value becomes its `{ "concept": "native.Text", "content": { "text": "text_value" } }` envelope instead. With `"format": "toml"`, the body carries `inputs_toml` (a string) in place of `inputs`.

A pipe that declares **no inputs** is a *valid* verdict, not an error: the template is simply empty (`{}` / `""`) and `message` says so — mirroring the CLI, which exits 0 on it.

**Response (invalid verdict):** `200` with `is_valid: false` and `validation_errors[]` — the same invalid arm every build endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "is_valid": false,
  "validation_errors": [
    { "category": "blueprint_validation", "message": "...", "source": "cv_matching.mthds" }
  ],
  "message": "..."
}
```

An item may also carry a `suggested_fix` — a structured, deterministic repair the runtime derived for that error. See [Error Responses → Suggested fixes](error-responses.md#suggested-fixes).

## Build Output

Generate the output representation for a pipe in one of three formats.

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/build/output`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "files": [{ "content": "...your MTHDS content..." }],
  "pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match",
  "format": "schema"
}
```

**Request Fields:** the shared envelope above, plus:

- `format` (string, optional): `"schema"` (default), `"json"`, or `"python"`. **Must be lowercase.**

**Format Options:**

- `schema` — JSON Schema representation of the output concept → parsed object in `output`
- `json` — Example JSON instance of the output → parsed object in `output`
- `python` — Python source defining the output class → raw text in `output_python`

As with `/build/inputs`, the representation rides the field its `format` names, and the other is omitted.

**Response (valid verdict, schema format):**

```json
{
  "is_valid": true,
  "pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match",
  "format": "schema",
  "output": {
    "concept": "MatchAnalysis",
    "content": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "score": { "title": "Score", "type": "integer", "description": "Match score 0-100" }
      },
      "required": ["score"]
    }
  },
  "message": "Output representation generated successfully"
}
```

One no-verdict special case: a pipe whose output is `native.Anything` and whose concrete options cannot be determined has no representation to render — a request-shape `422`, since that is a fact about the requested pipe, not about the closure.

The invalid verdict is the shared `is_valid: false` arm shown under Build Inputs.

## Build Runner

Generate a Python runner script for executing a pipe. The script's imports, example inputs, and output cast are spelled with the **emitted** class names of the typed-structures projection, and the response carries that projection alongside the script — the same stamped `structures.py` + `codegen.lock` a local `pipelex build runner` scaffolds (see [Resolve & Codegen](codegen.md) for the stamp/lock trust chain).

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/build/runner`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "files": [{ "content": "...your MTHDS content..." }],
  "pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match"
}
```

**Request Fields:** the shared envelope above, plus:

- `allow_signatures` (boolean, optional): tolerate unimplemented pipe signatures in the dry-run sweep (default `false`). This is the only build route that takes it — the only one that still sweeps.

The sweep is scoped to the requested pipe, so unrelated broken siblings do not block a good pipe. When `pipe_ref` is omitted the scope cannot be known before the closure loads, so the **whole closure** is swept and the pipe then defaults to its `main_pipe` — a stricter verdict, and the honest one for a caller who did not say which pipe they meant.

**Response (valid verdict):**

```json
{
  "is_valid": true,
  "pipe_ref": "cv_matching.analyze_cv_job_match",
  "python_code": "import sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n...",
  "structures": {
    "directory": "structures",
    "artifacts": [
      { "path": "structures.py", "content": "# >>> pipelex-codegen-stamp >>>\n..." }
    ],
    "lock": "# codegen.lock — generated artifact set (Pipelex codegen). Do not edit by hand.\n...",
    "lock_filename": "codegen.lock"
  },
  "message": "Runner code generated successfully"
}
```

To materialize a runnable tree, write `python_code` as the runner script and each `structures.artifacts[]` entry (plus `structures.lock` as `structures.lock_filename`) into the `structures.directory` beside it — the script imports from there (`from structures.structures import ...`).

The invalid verdict — including a failed dry-run of the requested pipe — is the shared `is_valid: false` arm shown under Build Inputs. One no-verdict special case: a requested pipe whose cross-package dependencies are absent from the request (recorded SKIPPED by the sweep) is a request-shape `422`, since no runner can be honestly generated without its dependency closure.
